🚀 Key Features
Hunger Heatmap: A real-time data visualization tool that tracks crowd density across various NUS dining halls (Fine Food, Frontier, Techno Edge, etc.).

The Hamster Wheel (Recommendation Engine): An intelligent filtering system that suggests meals based on:

User dietary restrictions (Halal, Vegetarian, etc.).

Current location and distance.

Budget-to-value ratio.

AI Fun Zone: Integrated sentiment analysis for food reviews to give students an honest look at what’s currently "hot" on campus.

🛠 Tech Stack
Frontend/Deployment: Streamlit (Rapid UI Prototyping)

Backend: Python

Data Processing: Pandas & NumPy (for heatmap calculations)

Logic: Custom recommendation algorithms based on multi-criteria decision making.

💻 Technical Highlights
Real-time Aggregation: Managed mock data streams to simulate live dining hall traffic, providing a foundation for future API integration with NUS dining services.

State Management: Utilized Streamlit’s session state to maintain user preferences across the recommendation workflow.

Responsive UI: Optimized for mobile browser use, ensuring students can check the "Hamster" while walking between lectures.
